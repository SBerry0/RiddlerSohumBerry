I found recurring two letter and three letter words and guessed what they might be which led me to find that each letter of the riddle was nine letters behind the actual letter. |

I forgot to exclude non-letters which took more time. Also, checking if the letter was lowercase vs. uppercase made it a little more difficult because their ascii values are different. |

With those numbers I thought it would be corresponding to the alphabet, but that didn't make sense. The next was to use unicode, which did work. I found helpful methods in the Java docs for Integer. |
| Aug 23 |  7:30-8:45pm  | I started working on the fourth riddle. My first idea was that the â›Ÿs are spaces because of their placement within the riddle. From there I guessed different combinations of letters that could correspond to an emoji, but it didn't turn anything up. Next, I tracked how many unique symbols there were to check if it actually could be a code where each symbol corresponds to a letter. There were 25 letters which made it reasonable that there would be one for each letter. Next I tried to convert the symbols into different things. ASCII didn't provide anything and neither did the unicode characters, but I started converting them into bytes and what I have seen so far looks promising. |
| Aug 28 |  4:45-5:45pm  |                            I started turning the dingbats into their unicode counterparts, but somewhere along the way, I messed up the subtraction to turn the hexadecimal number into an ASCII value. First I used the actual hexadecimal number to calculate the difference, but that didn't work. Then I used the base 10 number, which did eventually work, but I was using lowercase 'a' to calculate the difference. From there I went on a lot of print statements to see what different things were. Eventually, I tried with 'A', and it worked. I had separated what I thought were non-alphabetic characters from alphabetic characters using their hexadecimal value, but that wasn't necessary. |
